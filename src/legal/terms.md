You may not:

- Claim you invented the color lime

- Lost productivity due to staring at our gradient backgrounds
- Existential crises caused by questioning your previous design choices
- Sudden urges to rewrite all your projects using this starter

## 6. The Cookie Clause

- Cookies are delicious
- Digital cookies are less delicious but still useful
- You won't blame us for any cookie-related cravings

## 7. Changes to Terms

We reserve the right to modify these terms at any time. Changes will be effective immediately upon posting. We'll try to make them just as entertaining as the originals.

## 8. Governing Law

These terms shall be governed by the laws of the Internet, which as we all know, are mostly suggestions and memes.

## 9. Contact Information

If you have any questions about these terms, please contact us. We enjoy receiving emails that aren't spam.
