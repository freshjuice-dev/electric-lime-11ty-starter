## Your Privacy Matters (No, Really!)

We take your privacy seriously. So seriously that we wrote this entire page about it. That's commitment.

## What Information We Collect

### Information You Give Us

When you use our website, you might voluntarily provide:

- **Your admiration** - We can sense it through the screen
- **Contact form submissions** - If we have a contact form (check the contact page)
- **Your good vibes** - These are collected automatically and stored in our hearts

### Information Collected Automatically

When you visit our site, we might automatically collect:

- **Browser type** - Are you a Chrome person or a Firefox rebel?
- **Device type** - Phone, tablet, or a smart fridge? We don't judge
- **Pages visited** - So we know which pages are the cool kids
- **Time spent** - Hopefully long enough to appreciate our design choices

## How We Use Your Information

We use collected information to:

1. **Make the website better** - That's literally our job
2. **Understand our audience** - Are you humans or very sophisticated bots?
3. **Send you things** - Only if you ask us to, we promise
4. **Feel good about ourselves** - Those visitor numbers really boost morale

## Cookies

### What Are Cookies?

Cookies are small files stored on your device. Not the delicious kind. We know, we're disappointed too.

### Types of Cookies We Use

| Cookie Type | Purpose | Deliciousness Level |
|-------------|---------|---------------------|
| Essential | Make the site work | 0/10 (not edible) |
| Analytics | Help us improve | 0/10 (still not edible) |
| Preferences | Remember your settings | 0/10 (you seeing a pattern?) |

### Managing Cookies

You can disable cookies in your browser settings. The website might not work as well, and you'll hurt our feelings a little, but it's your choice.

## Third-Party Services

We might use third-party services that have their own privacy policies:

- **Analytics providers** - They help us count visitors without using our fingers
- **Font providers** - For those beautiful typefaces
- **CDN services** - Making the site fast and snappy

These third parties promise to be responsible with your data. We've given them the "please be nice" talk.

## Data Security

We protect your information using:

- **HTTPS** - The little padlock that makes everything secure
- **Common sense** - A surprisingly effective security measure
- **Good intentions** - Not legally binding, but we mean it

## Your Rights

You have the right to:

- **Access your data** - Ask us what we know about you
- **Delete your data** - Ask us to forget you (we'll try not to take it personally)
- **Opt out** - Say no to things you don't want
- **Complain** - We prefer constructive feedback, but you do you

## Children's Privacy

This website is not intended for children under 13. If you're under 13 and reading this, please:

1. Be impressed that you're reading a privacy policy
2. Ask a parent or guardian for permission
3. Consider a career in law, you've got the attention to detail

## International Users

We're on the internet, so you could be anywhere. If you're in the EU, GDPR applies. If you're on Mars, we're not sure what applies, but hello!

## Changes to This Policy

We might update this policy occasionally. When we do, we'll:

- Update the "last updated" date
- Try to make the new version equally entertaining
- Notify you if changes are significant

## Data Retention

We keep your data for as long as necessary, which means:

- **Analytics data** - Until we forget to check the dashboard
- **Contact submissions** - Until we respond (we try to be quick)
- **Your good vibes** - Forever, in our hearts

## Contact Us

*This privacy policy is for a demo starter template. For your actual website, please create a real privacy policy that complies with applicable laws. We recommend consulting with a legal professional who won't find this nearly as amusing as we do.*

**TL;DR:** This is a **demo template** for demonstration purposes only. This starter doesn't actually store, track, sniff, or collect any of your data - it's just static HTML with placeholder text. The source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/freshjuice-dev/electric-lime-11ty-starter). Replace this with your real privacy policy before going live!
