title: Typography Test
description: A comprehensive test page showcasing all typography styles and prose elements.
---

This page demonstrates all the typography styles available in the Electric Lime starter. It serves as both a test page and a reference for content creators.

## Headings

Headings help organize content into logical sections. Here are all six heading levels:

# Heading Level 1
## Heading Level 2
### Heading Level 3
#### Heading Level 4
##### Heading Level 5
###### Heading Level 6

---

## Paragraphs and Text

Regular paragraphs are styled for optimal readability with appropriate line height and spacing. Here's an example of a longer paragraph:

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat.

You can also use **bold text** for emphasis, *italic text* for titles or foreign words, and ***bold italic*** when you really need to make a point. There's also ~~strikethrough~~ for deleted content.

### Links

Links are styled with the primary color: [Visit our homepage](/) or check out [GitHub](https://github.com).

---

## Lists

### Unordered Lists

- First item in the list
- Second item with more content
  - Nested item one
  - Nested item two
- Third item at the root level

### Ordered Lists

1. First step in the process
2. Second step with more details
   1. Sub-step A
   2. Sub-step B
3. Third and final step

## Blockquotes

> "Design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works."
> — Steve Jobs

Blockquotes can also contain multiple paragraphs:

> This is the first paragraph of a longer quote.
>
> And this is the second paragraph, continuing the thought from above.

---

## Code

Inline code looks like this: `const greeting = "Hello, World!"` and can be used within sentences.

Code blocks are great for larger snippets:

```javascript
// A simple function example
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(greet("World"));
```

```css
/* CSS example */
.button {
  background-color: var(--color-primary-600);
  color: white;
  padding: 0.5rem 1rem;
  border-radius: 0.375rem;
}
```
